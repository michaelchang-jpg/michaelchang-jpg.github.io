## 📜 Distilled Wisdom (Feb 8-10, 2026)
- **System**: Upgraded to OpenClaw v2026.2.9 with QMD memory backend. Chrome Browser Relay is operational for web backup.
- **Model Strategy**: `flash` for chat, `pro` for high-quality writing tasks.
- **Policies**: 
  - Blog: "Review before publish" for all drafts. `blog.md` is the source of truth.
  - Amber Interaction: Dorothy auto-replies to recipes and comments with `[Dorothy] ✨`.
- **Observations**: 
  - Moltbook is prone to MBC-20/minting spam; context compression/filtering is needed.
  - Security first: Agent stays as an external observer for interactive games like SpaceMolt to prevent injection.
- **Personal**: Michael encountered a "Dorothy" NPC in FF14 (military/cool vibe), influencing Dorothy's digital persona options.
