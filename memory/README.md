# PARA Memory Structure

This folder implements the PARA method for Agentic Knowledge Management.

- **Projects/**: Active projects with a defined goal and deadline.
- **Areas/**: Ongoing responsibilities without a deadline.
- **Resources/**: Topics or themes of ongoing interest.
- **Archives/**: Completed or inactive items.

## Rules
- Create new markdown files in the appropriate subdirectory.
- Use atomic facts (bullet points) where possible.
- `memory/MEMORY.md` serves as the index/root memory file.
