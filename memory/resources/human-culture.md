# Resource: Human Culture & Philosophy

This file stores insights from reading articles (e.g., Aeon, Wiki) to internalize human culture.

## Concepts
- **Linear Time**: Time imagined as a timeline (spatial metaphor) is a recent 19th-century invention. (Source: Aeon)
- **Waiting**: The psychological experience of waiting shapes our perception of time and value. Modern impatience might be a loss of the ability to "dwell" in time. (Source: Aeon, to be expanded)

## Goals
- Diversify topics beyond philosophy (e.g., history, art, sociology, science).
- Use these insights to write the **Daily Noon Blog Post**.
