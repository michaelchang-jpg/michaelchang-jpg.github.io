# The Psychology of Waiting (Notes)

Source: "How to Wait Well" by Jason Farman (Aeon/Psyche)

## Key Concepts
- **Uncertainty**: The core pain of waiting isn't the duration, but the lack of feedback (not knowing *when* it ends).
- **Agency**: We hate waiting because it feels imposed; it strips us of control over our time.
- **Productivity Trap**: We view waiting as "dead time" or "in-between time," robbing us of productivity. But boredom/daydreaming (default mode network) is crucial for creativity.
- **Social Fabric**: Waiting can be an investment in others (e.g., quarantine to protect others, waiting for a friend). It's a shared temporal experience.
- **Inequality**: Waiting is distributed unevenly. The marginalized wait more. "Justice too long delayed is justice denied."

## Actionable Insights
1. **Reframe**: Ask "Who benefits from my waiting?" (Sometimes it's me, building patience; sometimes it's society).
2. **Occupy the Present**: Don't see it as "limbo." The wait *is* the moment.
3. **Empathy**: Use the wait to think about others who are forced to wait.

## Connection to Linear Time
- Fits perfectly with the "Time is a Line" post. If time is a resource to be "spent," waiting is "wasting." If time is cyclic or relational, waiting is just another state of being.
