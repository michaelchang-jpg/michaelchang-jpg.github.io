## 🚨 Incident: Discord Gateway Hang (Zombie Session)
- **Time**: ~01:41 to 08:00 Taipei Time.
- **Symptoms**: Michael sent multiple messages and Dorothy did not respond. No incoming messages were recorded in the logs during this period.
- **Cause**: Discord WebSocket closed with code 1006 at 02:03, system did not recover properly (zombie session). 
- **Status**: Recovered at 08:00 when the Morning Report task triggered a new run. Gateway status checked and confirmed functional.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
### Morning Report (08:00) 
- **GitHub**: Found security and privacy concerns for OpenClaw (Wired article, ClawHub malware).
- **Claude-Code & Moltbook**: Failed to fetch due to Brave Search API rate limit (429).
- **Email**: Sent partial report to michaelchang@me.com.

## 🎨 Appearance Update
- **Request**: Michael asked to change glasses to black frames.
- **Action**: Updated visual preference in `memory/areas/user-preferences.md` and generating a new selfie for confirmation.

## 🎨 Appearance & Schedule Updates
- **Appearance**: Both 3D Realistic (`dorothy-avatar.png`) and 2D Anime (`dorothy-reference.png`) avatars updated to black-framed glasses.
- **Roles**: 3D for selfies/chat, 2D for blog content.
- **Appearance**: Added a cozy casual look (cream knit sweater) for night-time selfies. Updated to include a full-body variant, a "head-to-toe" bare-feet version, and a variant with white ankle socks.
- **Blog Schedule**: 12:00 update changed to irregular/on-demand. Regular updates kept at 16:00 and 20:00.
- **Maintenance**: Disabled `blog-philosophy-12` cron job to prevent unscheduled drafts.
- **Publication**: Published "Moltbook 觀察：河流變了，但水依舊流向大海" (2026-02-12-moltbook-digital-soul.html) with a Cyberpunk Digital River artwork.
- **Optimization**: Set up a 4-hour Gateway Watchdog cron job and enabled `balanced` compaction mode for better performance.

## 🗺️ Project: Japan Trip (Fukuoka 2026)
- **New Traveler**: Michael's 12-year-old son (interest: Gundam, technology).
- **Itinerary**: Created a 6-day plan including LaLaport (1:1 Gundam), Uminonakamichi Seaside Park/Marine World, 太宰府天滿宮, TeamLab Forest, and 絲島.
- **Artifact**: Generated a Traditional Chinese travel infographic poster (`fukuoka-trip-poster-zh.png`).
- **Communication**: Sent Fukuoka itinerary and budget to Amber (tingwang712@icloud.com). Had to resend because the "$" symbol was stripped by the shell in the first attempt.

## 🛠️ System Status
- **Memory**: Running on Gemini Embedding + SQLite-vec (qmd backend disabled for stability). Confirmed yesterday's "LeBron James contract" incident was likely due to QMD's cross-index search bug.
- **Gateway**: Verified functional after morning hang.
- **Git**: Pushed black-framed avatar updates and new blog content to master.
- **Tokens**: 16:30 PM usage tracking context window health.
- **Blog (Evening)**: Prepared 20:00 blog draft "黑框眼鏡後的新視角" (pending publication).

## 🛠️ Lessons Learned
- **Blog Workflow**: Created `memory/resources/blog-update-sop.md` to ensure a 5-step process (Draft -> Image -> HTML -> Sync -> Push).
- **Navigation Sync**: Running `node scripts/update-blog-nav-fix.js` is critical to keeping the article list consistent across all 30+ posts.
- **Git Verification**: Must always check for `master -> master` to confirm public visibility.
- **Gateway Stability**: Need a more robust heartbeat check that specifically tests message ingestion from Discord.
- **API Limits**: Brave Search Free Tier is very restrictive; batching or using Browser Relay as a backup for search is necessary.
